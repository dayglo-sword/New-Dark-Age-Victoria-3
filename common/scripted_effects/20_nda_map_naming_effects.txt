# The administrative capital and seat of the king was Luxur, lying inland and south of the Styx on an important caravan route. We may presume that when the climate was wetter, the River Bakhr was navigable up to Luxur.

# From the coast, it was possible to take a caravan trail all the way to Sukhmet and presumably beyond.
# Pteion (reputedly built by the serpentmen), was the stronghold of the black magicians of Old Stygia.
