Discrimination trait groups need to have a type defined. This type can be heritage or language. Religious discrimination trait groups work the same as cultura ones.

Examples:

heritage_group_african = {
	type = heritage
}

language_group_ainuic = {
	type = language
}

heritage_group_abrahamic = {
	type = heritage
}
