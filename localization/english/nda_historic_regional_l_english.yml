nda_historic_regional.1848.t: "The Great Serpent Mound" 
nda_historic_regional.1848.d: "The Smithsonian has released a book #ITALICAncient Monuments of the Mississippi Valley#!, authored by Ephraim George Squier and Edwin Hamilton Davis. It describes the many unexplained features along the valley, presumably built in antiquity by the original inhabitants of the region.\n\nThe most notable of these features is 'The Great Serpent Mound', in Adams county, Ohio.\n\nSituated upon a high, cresent-form hill, the mound is over 1400 feet long and 3 feet high.\n\nThe identity of the builders of the effigy remain unknown."
nda_historic_regional.1848.f: "'Probably the most extraordinary earthwork thus far discovered is the Great Serpent...\n\nNo plan or description has hitherto been published; nor does the fact of its existence appear to have been known beyond the secluded vicinity in which it occurs.\n\nIts mouth is open wide as if in the act of swallowing or ejecting an oval figure, which rests partially with the distended jaws.\n\nThe serpent has been a predominant symbol amoung many primitive nations. It prevailed in Egypt, Greece, and Assyria. It even penetrated into America; and was conspicuous in the mythology of the ancient Mexicans...'"
nda_historic_regional.1848.a: "But who built it?"

nda_historic_regional.1864.t: "The Mammals of Madagascar" 
nda_historic_regional.1864.d: "An article entitled 'The Mammals of Madagascar' by zoologist and biogeographer Philip Sclater has appeared in The Quarterly Journal of Science, published in London.\n\nThey seem to have come up with an interesting theory as to why the fossilized remains of Lemurs have been found in India, far from their home in Madagascar, but not one has been found in Africa or the Middle East."
nda_historic_regional.1864.f: "'The anomalies of the mammal fauna of Madagascar can best be explained by supposing that...\n\n a large continent occupied parts of the Atlantic and Indian Oceans...\n\n that this continent was broken up into islands, of which some have become amalgamated with Africa, some with what is now Asia; and that in Madagascar and the Mascarene Islands we have existing relics of this great continent, for which...\n\n I should propose the name Lemuria!'"

nda_historic_regional.1870.t: "Hollow Inside" 
nda_historic_regional.1870.d: "After being electrocuted while conducting an experiment, Cyrus Teed of New York claims to have been visited by a divine spirit which enlightened him on the true nature of the world. As well as now claiming to be the Messiah, they have now formed their own religion, 'Koreshanity'.\n\nHe is also promoting the theory that the Earth is in fact hollow. Unlike other similar theories promoted in the past, he claims we are all living on the inner surface of the shell - on a concave sphere looking up at the center Sun."
nda_historic_regional.1870.f: "'In 1870, the Author of the Koreshan System of Universology, upon the basis of the law of comparative analogy, announced the discovery of the cosmogonic form, which he then declared to be cellular, the surface of the earth being concave, with a curvature of about eight inches to the mile. This rate of curvation would give a diameter of eight thousand, and a circumference of twenty-five thousand miles.\n\nApplying the common laws and principles of optics, with perspective foreshortening, all the phenomena of appearances in optical illusion were scientifically accounted for, and the earth optically demonstrated to be concave, although visual appearances seemed to indicate the contrary.'\n - Cellular Cosmogony, or, the Earth a Concave Sphere, published 1905."

nda_historic_regional.1890.d: "Charles Kennard of Baltimore has set up the Kennard Novelty Company to distribute a new board game.\n\nAn advert running in newspapers announces it as 'The Ouija: The Wonder of the 19th Century'.\n\nIt seems to be based upon a short lived party craze that occured in Ohio a few years back."
nda_historic_regional.1890.f: "'By simply resting the fingers of two persons upon the small table it moves, and to all intents and purposes becomes a living sensible thing giving inteligent answers to any questions that can be propounded...\n\nfor sale by all first-class Toy Dealers and Stationers.'"
nda_historic_regional.1890.a: "A silly toy..."

nda_historic_regional.1892.t: "The Great Sea-Serpent" 
nda_historic_regional.1892.d: "The noted zoologist #ITALIC Anthonie Cornelis Oudemans#!, director of the Zoological Gardens at The Hague, has published the results of years of research. This 600 page book, titled 'The Great Sea-Serpent', is the first serious study into the matter.\n\n Oudemans has come to the conclusion that these creatures, which he has categorised as 'Megophia Megopias', do in fact exist."
nda_historic_regional.1892.f: "'After giving a bibliography of the subject, an account of the many cheats and hoaxes, and of a number of 'would-be sea serpents', he proceeds to collate very carefully all the material he has so laboriously brought together. We believe no one has preceded him in this method'\n - Army and Navy Gazette"

nda_historic_regional.1901.t: "The Horos Trial" 
nda_historic_regional.1901.d: "A trial has reached its conclusion in London, sheading light into the inner working of the 'Golden Dawn' and causing a rift between its members.\n\n Fräulein Sprengel was visiting Mathers; At a meeting of Ahathöor Temple, Mathers introduced her as Soror S.D.A., a 5=6 Adeptus Minor from Thmê Temple No. 8.\n\nIn actuality, she and her husband were elaborate American spiritual charlatans Frank and Editha (Saloman) Jackson, using the pseudonyms Theo and Laura Horos;\n\n After their visit the Horoses made off with a stash of Order papers, including a set of the Outer Order ceremonies.\n\n With the Order’s ceremonies in hand, they set up a cult called the Theocratic Unity.  After many were taken in by their con, the couple were eventually caught and arrested for fraud and statutory rape, conducted as part of a “Golden Dawn initiation”. \n\nIn the course of the trial, the Golden Dawn ceremonies were read in open court.\n\nOnce this happened, both the allegiant and rebel factions of the Order had little choice but to distance themselves from the Golden Dawn name. \n\nThe trial ends with Theo being sent to prison for fifteen years and Laura for seven."
