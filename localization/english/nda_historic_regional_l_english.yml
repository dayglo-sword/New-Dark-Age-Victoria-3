nda_historic_regional.1848.t: "The Great Serpent Mound" 
nda_historic_regional.1848.d: "The Smithsonian has released a book #BLUE Ancient Monuments of the Mississippi Valley#!, authored by #GREEN Ephraim George Squier#! and #GREEN Edwin Hamilton Davis#!. It describes the many unexplained features along the valley, presumably built in antiquity by the original inhabitants of the region.\n\nThe most notable of these features is #BLUE 'The Great Serpent Mound' #!, in Adams County, Ohio.\n\nSituated upon a high, cresent-form hill, the mound is over 1400 feet long and 3 feet high.\n\nThe identity of the builders of the effigy remain unknown."
nda_historic_regional.1848.f: "'Probably the most extraordinary earthwork thus far discovered is the Great Serpent...\n\nNo plan or description has hitherto been published; nor does the fact of its existence appear to have been known beyond the secluded vicinity in which it occurs.\n\nIts mouth is open wide as if in the act of swallowing or ejecting an oval figure, which rests partially with the distended jaws.\n\nThe serpent has been a predominant symbol amoung many primitive nations. It prevailed in Egypt, Greece, and Assyria. It even penetrated into America; and was conspicuous in the mythology of the ancient Mexicans...'"
nda_historic_regional.1848.a: "But who built it?"

nda_historic_regional.1860.t: "A Lost City?" 
nda_historic_regional.1860.d: "A French naturalist, #GREEN Henri Mouhot#!, has apparently come across a vast city hidden in the jungles of South-East Asia!\n\n He was following on the trail of a missionary, Father Bouillevaux, who had passed this way a decade earlier.\n\nThe city appears to cover a vast area, full of shires and palaces, with irrigation and terraces sourrounding them. This would put some modern cities to shame!"
nda_historic_regional.1860.f: "'if you interrogate the Cambodians as to the founders of Ongcor-Wat, you invariably receive one of these four replies: “It is the work of Pra-Eun, the king of the angels;” “It is the work of the giants;” “It was built by the leprous king;” or else, “It made itself.”'\n\n'...to drag in contrary directions the great serpent or dragon with seven heads, while, in the centre, an angel stands looking on... ...The angel is seated on the celebrated mountain of Thibet, Pra Soumer, and in different places angels with several heads give assistance to those pulling the serpent.'\n\n - Henri Mouhot"

nda_historic_regional.1864.t: "The Mammals of Madagascar" 
nda_historic_regional.1864.d: "An article entitled #BLUE 'The Mammals of Madagascar'#! by zoologist and biogeographer #GREEN Philip Sclater#! has appeared in The Quarterly Journal of Science, published in London.\n\nThey seem to have come up with an interesting theory as to why the fossilized remains of Lemurs have been found in India, far from their home in Madagascar, but not one has been found in Africa or the Middle East."
nda_historic_regional.1864.f: "'The anomalies of the mammal fauna of Madagascar can best be explained by supposing that...\n\n a large continent occupied parts of the Atlantic and Indian Oceans...\n\n that this continent was broken up into islands, of which some have become amalgamated with Africa, some with what is now Asia; and that in Madagascar and the Mascarene Islands we have existing relics of this great continent, for which...\n\n I should propose the name Lemuria!'"

nda_historic_regional.1870.t: "Hollow Inside" 
nda_historic_regional.1870.d: "After being electrocuted while conducting an experiment, #GREEN Cyrus Teed#! of New York claims to have been visited by a divine spirit which enlightened him on the true nature of the world. As well as now claiming to be the Messiah, they have now formed their own religion, #BLUE 'Koreshanity'#!.\n\nHe is also promoting the theory that the Earth is in fact hollow. Unlike other similar theories promoted in the past, he claims we are all living on the inner surface of the shell - on a concave sphere looking up at the center Sun."
nda_historic_regional.1870.f: "'In 1870, the Author of the Koreshan System of Universology, upon the basis of the law of comparative analogy, announced the discovery of the cosmogonic form, which he then declared to be cellular, the surface of the earth being concave, with a curvature of about eight inches to the mile. This rate of curvation would give a diameter of eight thousand, and a circumference of twenty-five thousand miles.\n\nApplying the common laws and principles of optics, with perspective foreshortening, all the phenomena of appearances in optical illusion were scientifically accounted for, and the earth optically demonstrated to be concave, although visual appearances seemed to indicate the contrary.'\n - Cellular Cosmogony, or, the Earth a Concave Sphere, published 1905."

nda_historic_regional.1878.d: "A new organisation promoting Theosophy has been formally approved by the 'Parent Society'.\n\n The #BLUE British Theosophical Society#! has held its first official meeting at 38, Great Russell St., London.\n\nIt has taken two years to get this far after following the guidance of #GREEN Colonel Olcott#!\n\nThe majority of its members appear to be former Spiritualists."
nda_historic_regional.1878.f: "'In England, four out of five of the original group were members of the British National Association of Spiritualists, as well as the first two presidents, Mr. C. C. Massey and Dr. George Wyld. During the first year of its existence, the English Theosophical Society continued to be recruited almost entirely, if not solely, from the Spiritualist ranks...\n\n...there can be no doubt that Spiritualists, in consequence of their familiarity with the phenomena so largely commented on in Isis Unveiled, brought to the study of occult matters a certain preparedness of mind for the reception of the new teaching;'\n - Spiritualism In Its Relation to Theosophy - (1892) Emily Kislingbury, FTS."

nda_historic_regional.1882.d: "#GREEN Ignatius Loyola Donnelly#!, a politician from Minnesota, has released a book supporting the idea of Plato's lost realm of [concept_nda_atlantis].\n\nAccording to Donnelly, it was a large island, opposite the Mediterranean Sea, and which was the remnant of a greater Atlantic continent.\n\nIt is also suppose to be the original homeland of the Aryan and Semetic peoples."
nda_historic_regional.1882.f: "'Plato says that in Atlantis there was a great and wonderful empire, which aggressed wantonly against the whole of Europe and Asia, thus testifying to the extent of its dominion.\n\nIt not only subjugated Africa as far as Egypt, and Europe as far as Italy, but it ruled as well over parts of the continent, to wit, the opposite continent of America, which surrounded the true ocean.\n\nThose parts of America over which it ruled were, as we will show hereafter, Central America, Peru, and the Valley of the Mississippi, occupied by the 'Mound Builders'.\n - Atlantis: The Antediluvian World "

nda_historic_regional.1887.f: "'The name of the present magazine -- rather equivocal to orthodox Christian ears -- is due to no careless selection, but arose in consequence of much thinking over its fitness, and was adopted as the best symbol to express that object and the results in view.\n\n Now, the first and most important, if not the sole object of the magazine, is expressed in the line from the 1st Epistle to the Corinthians, on its title page. It is to bring light to 'the hidden things of darkness,' ; to show in their true aspect and their original real meaning things and names, men and their doings and customs; it is finally to fight prejudice, hypocrisy and shams in every nation, in every class of Society, as in every department of life.\n\nThe task is a laborious one but it is neither impracticable nor useless, if even as an experiment.'\n - Issue I, H. P. Blavatsky"

nda_historic_regional.1890.f: "'By simply resting the fingers of two persons upon the small table it moves, and to all intents and purposes becomes a living sensible thing giving inteligent answers to any questions that can be propounded...\n\nfor sale by all first-class Toy Dealers and Stationers.'"

nda_historic_regional.1892.f: "'After giving a bibliography of the subject, an account of the many cheats and hoaxes, and of a number of 'would-be sea serpents', he proceeds to collate very carefully all the material he has so laboriously brought together.

After many were taken in by their con, the couple were eventually caught and arrested for fraud and statutory rape, conducted as part of a “Golden Dawn initiation”. \n\nIn the course of the trial, the Golden Dawn ceremonies were read in open court.\n\nOnce this happened, both the allegiant and rebel factions of the Order had little choice but to distance themselves from the Golden Dawn name. \n\nThe trial ends with Theo being sent to prison for fifteen years and Laura for seven."
