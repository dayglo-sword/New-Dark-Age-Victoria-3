Over the water are the island of Marabout and the headland of Agame, which are part of the same limestone chain as Ras-el-Tin, and connected with it by submarine reefs.\n\nThe sea west and north of the point is full of remains of the Prehistoric Harbour.'\n\nAlexandria: A History and a Guide - E.

nda_nephrenka.25.d: "It was purely by accident that [SCOPE.sCharacter('nda_nile_expedition_leader').GetFullName] came across the artifact in the local bazaar.\n\nAlthough small in nature the inscriptions upon it seem to imply a link to the tombs that the expedition is looking for."

nda_nephrenka.27.f: "'An antiquarian discovery of great interest to Egyptologists has been made at Luxor, where, after twelve months spent in excavating the tomb of Queen Hatasoo, who flourished about 1500 B.C. —that is to say, some 3,400 years ago- her sarcophagus has been discovered.It is in perfect preservation.\n\n It was Queen Hatasoo, or, more correctly, Hatshepeut Maat Ka-Ra, who raised two obelisks at Karnak, and who built the temple of Der el Bahri, near Thebes.'\n- Weekly Mail, May 1904"

The entrance was a good way above his head, of course, and quite fifty or sixty yards from the point where he was standing, but the moonbeams bathed that side of the building in dazzling light so that he was enabled to see a perfect crowd of bats whirling out of the pyramid.\n\nThat indescribable smell, as of a decay begun in remote ages, that rises with the impalpable dust in these mysterious labyrinths of Ancient Egypt which never know the light of day, rose stiflingly; until, at some forty or fifty feet below the level of the sand outside, respiration became difficult "
