nda_migo.1.t: "A Restless Sleep"
nda_migo.1.d: "A noise not dissimilar to the sound of swarming Bees wakes you from your peaceful slumber...\n\nAt the base of your bed you behold an hideous pink bat-winged monstrosty with antennae where its head should logically be.\n\nWith a strange buzzing they proceed to speak to you..."
nda_migo.1.f: "'We are the [Concept('concept_nda_migo','$concept_nda_migo_short$')] from the realm of [concept_nda_yuggoth], we have travelled far from your future to study these times...'\n\n'You appear to be a likely candidate for our experiment. We will make you an offer...  In return for immortality you will agree to be our agent in this aeon... recording the history of these dark times from the view point of the actual leaders of the world.'\n\n'This will of course require you to leave this country for a long while, and will require a certain amount of surgery to get your brain functions to where we desire them.'\n\n\n#red WARNING - Accepting this offer will put you on an alternative 'country-hop' path - This is not recommended if this is your first play-through.#!"

nda_migo.2.t: "All A Dream."
nda_migo.2.d: "You wake up with a start in the morning to the smell of ozone and soiled bedsheets.\n\nThere are a number of strange burn marks on the floor near your bed.\n\nYou doubt that anyone sane will believe your excuses, but at least you can continue to pull the strings of your country."
nda_migo.2.f: "'...according to the earliest legends the creatures would appear to have harmed only those trespassing on their privacy; there were later accounts of their curiosity respecting men, and of their attempts to establish secret outposts in the human world...\n\n...it must imply some actual historicity for the ancient tales; that it must argue the real existence of some queer elder earth-race, driven to hiding after the advent and dominance of mankind, which might very conceivably have survived...'"
nda_migo.2.a: "I Need Breakfast."
nda_migo.3.t: "We Will Return"
nda_migo.3.d: "The Alien creature waves their appendages in approval. They tell you that they will return within the decade to conduct the next stage of the experiment.\n\n Apparently at this point you will obtain your new body, some poor victim in a far off land.\n\n'Be careful not to die in the meantime.' they warn, 'and beware the servants of Hastur.'"
nda_migo.3.f: "'...who at some period of life appeared to have undergone a repellent mental change, and who were shunned and whispered about as mortals who had sold themselves to the strange beings. ...it seemed to be a fashion about 1800 to accuse eccentric and unpopular recluses of being allies or representatives of the abhorred things...\n\n...It is true — terribly true — that there are non-human creatures watching us all the time; with spies among us gathering information. It is from a wretched man who, if he was sane (as I think he was), was one of those spies, that I got a large part of my clues to the matter...'"
nda_migo.3.a: "See You Soon..."
nda_migo.4.t: "Time To Move On"
nda_migo.4.d: "It is time. The Mi-Go are implementing the next phase of their experiment and you will depart both your body and this land.\n\nThey transport you to their hidden laboratory and prepare the canister where your brain will be hosted till they find a sutable victim for the next stage of the experiment.\n\nWill anybody notice that their former leader is now a mindless husk?"
nda_migo.4.f: "'...I shiver when I try to figure out the real reason why its monstrous denizens wish it to be known in this way at this especial time. I vainly try to assure myself that these daemoniac creatures are not gradually leading up to some new policy hurtful to the earth and its normal inhabitants...'"
nda_migo.4.a: "I Hate The Sound Of That Saw..."
nda_migo.5.t: "A New Place"
nda_migo.5.d: "After what seems like an eternity your brain is transplanted into a new human receptacle.\n\nA new body and a new country awaits...\n\nWill anyone notice the change in the behaviour of their leader?\n\nWill they accept a new direction if it is imposed?"
nda_migo.5.f: "'...was gone without leaving a trace. His loose dressing-gown, yellow scarf, and foot-bandages lay on the study floor near his corner easy-chair, and it could not be decided whether any of his other apparel had vanished with him.\n\n ...nothing unusual could be detected. No cylinders or machines, no queer odour or vibration-sense, no footprints in the road...'"

nda_migo.1878.d: "The Mi-Go have contacted you again.\n\nThey seem deeply concerned about events in LOCATION, as it appears an ancient lost artifact has been uncovered in an old church, and is now in the hands of the government.\n\nThey are wondering if there is anything that you can do in your current position to aquire the relic.\n\n #ITALIC We must have it so we can return it to the point of its supposed creation so that we can have it again! #!"

nda_migo.1878.f: "'Of the Shining Trapezohedron... a window on all time and space, and tracing its history from the days it was fashioned on dark Yuggoth, before ever the Old Ones brought it to earth.\n\nIt was treasured and placed in its curious box by the crinoid things of Antarctica, salvaged from their ruins by the serpent-men of Valusia, and peered at aeons later in Lemuria by the first human beings.\n\nIt crossed strange lands and stranger seas, and sank with Atlantis, only to be later recovered from the deep.\n\nThe Pharaoh Nephren-Ka built around it a temple with a windowless crypt, and did that which caused his name to be stricken from all monuments and records.\n\n...a kaleidoscopic range of phantasmal images played, all of them dissolving at intervals into the picture of a vast, unplumbed abyss of night wherein whirled suns and worlds of an even profounder blackness.\n\n...the ancient legends of Ultimate Chaos, at whose centre sprawls the blind idiot god Azathoth, Lord of All Things, encircled by his flopping horde of mindless and amorphous dancers, and lulled by the thin monotonous piping of a demoniac flute held in nameless paws.'" # same as nda_nen.80

nda_migo.1935.f:1 "...To visit Yuggoth would drive any weak man mad - yet I am going there.
