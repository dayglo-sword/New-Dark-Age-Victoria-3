nda_hgw.10.t: "Comet Sighted?"
nda_hgw.10.d: "Astronomers are reporting a strange object in the depths of the outer solar system.\n\nIt appears to be large enough to disturb the very paths of the planets."
nda_hgw.10.f: "'It was on the first day of the new year that the announcement was made, almost simultaneously from three observatories, that the motion of the planet Neptune, the outermost of all the planets that wheeled about the sun, had become erratic. Such a piece of news was scarcely calculated to interest the world the greater portion of whose inhabitants were unaware of the existence of the planet Neptune, nor outside the astronomical profession did the subsequent discovery of a faint remote speck of light in the region of the perturbed planet cause any great excitement.\n\nScientific people, however, found the intelligence remarkable enough, even before it became known that the new body was rapidly growing larger and brighter, that its motion was quite different from the orderly progress of the planets, and that the deflection of Neptune and its satellite was becoming now of an unprecedented kind.'"
nda_hgw.10.a: "Interesting"

nda_hgw.11.t: "A New Star"
nda_hgw.11.d: "The object is now clearly visible in the sky, both during night and day.\n\nIt appears to be rapidly moving on a course towards the Earth, getting larger with each passing day!"
nda_hgw.11.f: "'The star grew — it grew with a terrible steadiness hour after hour, a little larger each hour, a little nearer the midnight zenith, and brighter and brighter, until it had turned night into day.\n\nHad it come straight to the earth instead of in a curved path, had it lost no velocity to Jupiter, it must have leapt the intervening gulf in a day; but as it was it took five days altogether to come by our planet.\n\nThe next night it had become a third the size of the moon before it set to English eyes, and the thaw was assured.'"
nda_hgw.11.a: "What to do?"

nda_hgw.12.t: "Disaster!"
nda_hgw.12.d: "The 'Star', as it is being called, has passed close to Earth but has wrought devestation in its passing\n\nThe point of closest approach has been scorched barren. The tides caused spawning devestating Tsunamis around the globe."
nda_hgw.12.f: "'...the storms drove the waters in many cases scores of miles inland, drowning whole cities. And so great grew the heat during the night that the rising of the sun was like the coming of a shadow.\n\n...jungles were aflame in a thousand places, and below the hurrying waters around the stems were dark objects that struggled feebly and reflected the blood red tongues of fire. And in a ungovernable confusion a multitude of men and women fled down the broad riverways to that one last hope of men — the open sea.\n\nLarger grew the star, and larger, hotter, and brighter with a terrible swiftness now. The tropical ocean had lost its phosphorescence, and the whirling steam rose in ghostly wreaths from the black waves that plunged incessantly, speckled with storm-tossed ships.'"
nda_hgw.12.a: "Disaster!"

nda_hgw.13.t: "A Near Escape"
nda_hgw.13.d: "The World must now pick up the pieces in the aftermath of this apocalyptic calamity.\n\nWho is capable of rebuilding society?\nWhat does the future hold?"
nda_hgw.13.f: "'The Martian astronomers — for there are astronomers on Mars, although they are different beings from men — were naturally profoundly interested by these things.\n\nThey saw them from their own standpoint, of course...\n\n“Considering the mass and temperature of the missile that was flung through our solar system into the sun,” one wrote, “it is astonishing what little damage the earth, which it missed so narrowly, has sustained. All the familiar continental markings and the masses of the seas remain intact, and indeed the only difference seems to be a shrinkage of the white discoloration (supposed to be frozen water) round either pole.”\n\nWhich only shows how small the vastest of human catastrophies may seem at a distance of a few million miles.'"
nda_hgw.13.a: "Time To Rebuild"

nda_hgw.20.t: "Into The Abyss?"
nda_hgw.20.d1: "Our recent focus on submersible vessels have lead to an approach by the inventor #GREEN Elstead#!, who is seeking to travel to the depths of the oceans in a spherical contraption of steel. He is seeking our Navy's help in the matter.\n\n[SCOPE.sCharacter('nda_abyss_leader').GetPrimaryRoleTitle] [SCOPE.sCharacter('nda_abyss_leader').GetFullName] feels that we should be supportive as it could greatly progress our undersea research."
nda_hgw.20.d2: "Our recent focus on submersible vessels have lead to an approach by the inventor #GREEN Elstead#!, who is seeking to travel to the depths of the oceans in a spherical contraption of steel. He is seeking our Navy's help in the matter.\n\nA number of our admirals feel that we should be supportive as it could progress our undersea research."
nda_hgw.20.f: "'But think of the pressure,... At the surface of the water it’s fourteen pounds to the inch, thirty feet down it’s double that; sixty, treble; ninety, four times; nine hundred, forty times; five thousand, three hundred — that’s a mile — it’s two hundred and forty times fourteen pounds; that’s — let’s see — thirty hundredweight — a ton and a half, Steevens; a ton and a half to the square inch. And the ocean where he’s going is five miles deep.'\n\n'“Sounds a lot,” said Steevens, “but it’s jolly thick steel.”'"
nda_hgw.20.a: "Into the Abyss!"
nda_hgw.20.b: "This is too dangerous."

nda_hgw.21.t: "In The Abyss"
nda_hgw.21.d: "After a great scare, where contact was lost for a number of days, #GREEN Elstead#! has reappered on the surface in his metal sphere.\n\nThey have a rather fantastic tale to tell"
nda_hgw.21.f: "He was not dead, they found, but in a state of absolute nervous collapse, and besides cruelly bruised. For some days he had to lie perfectly still. It was a week before he could tell his experiences.\n\n'You thought I should find nothing but ooze,” he said. “You laughed at my explorations, and I’ve discovered a new world!'\n\n'It was a strange vertebrated animal. Its dark purple head was dimly suggestive of a chameleon, but it had such a high forehead and such a braincase as no reptile ever displayed before; the vertical pitch of its face gave it a most extraordinary resemblance to a human being...\n\n...Two large and protruding eyes projected from sockets in chameleon fashion, and it had a broad reptilian mouth with horny lips beneath its little nostrils. In the position of the ears were two huge gill-covers, and out of these floated a branching tree of coralline filaments, almost like the tree-like gills that very young rays and sharks possess.\n\nHe could make out an arrangement suggestive of streets and houses grouped about a vast roofless erection that was grotesquely suggestive of a ruined abbey.'"
nda_hgw.21.a: "Interesting"

nda_hgw.22.t: "The Abyss"
nda_hgw.22.d: "Terrible news has reached us.\n\n#GREEN Elstead#! has made a second descent into the ocean abyss, with the improvements his first experience suggested.\n\nWhat happened we shall probably never know. He never returned. The ship beat about over the point of his submersion, seeking him in vain for thirteen days. Then she returned to port, and the news was telegraphed to his friends.\n\nBut it is hardly probable that no further attempt will be made to verify his strange story of these hitherto unsuspected cities of the deep sea."
nda_hgw.22.f: "'We see the thing darkly in fragmentary glimpses—the huge ghostly building, the bowing, chanting people, with their dark chameleon-like heads and faintly luminous clothing,...'\n\n'And such walls they were, of water-logged wood, and twisted wire-rope, and iron spars, and copper, and the bones and skulls of dead men. The skulls ran in zigzag lines and spirals and fantastic curves over the building; and in and out of their eye-sockets, and over the whole surface of the place, lurked and played a multitude of silvery little fishes.'\n\n'he made his second descent into the ocean abyss, with the improvements his first experience suggested. What happened we shall probably never know. He never returned.'"
nda_hgw.22.a: "A nasty end."


nda_hgw.25.t: "Extraordinary affair at Sidmouth"
nda_hgw.25.d: "Zoologists are altogether at a loss to account for the sudden appearance on the Devon coast of a new underwater species they have named 'Haploteuthis ferox'.\n\nTaken together with the wave of boating and bathing casualties, and the absence of fish from the Cornish coasts that year, it points clearly to a shoal of these voracious deep-sea monsters prowling slowly along the sub-tidal coastline."
nda_hgw.25.f: "'They have a shape somewhat resembling an octopus, and with huge and very long and flexible tentacles, coiled copiously on the ground. The skin has a glistening texture, unpleasant to see, like shiny leather. The downward bend of the tentacle-surrounded mouth, the curious excrescence at the bend, the tentacles, and the large intelligent eyes, gives the creatures a grotesque suggestion of a face.\n\n...a pack or shoal of these creatures may have become enamoured of human flesh by the accident of a foundered ship sinking among them, and have wandered in search of it out of their accustomed zone; first waylaying and following ships, and so coming to our shores in the wake of the Atlantic traffic'\n\n'The creatures, it seems, like most deep-sea organisms, were phosphorescent, and they had been floating, five fathoms deep or so, like creatures of moonshine through the blackness of the water, their tentacles retracted and as if asleep, rolling over and over, and moving slowly in a wedge-like formation towards the south-east.'"
nda_hgw.25.a: "Stay out of the water!"
nda_hgw.25.b: "Meet the relatives!"
