Its leader, [SCOPE.sCharacter('prof_webb_scope').GetFullName], had a rather strange tale to tell.\n\nWhilst high up on the West Greenland coast they had encountered a singular tribe or cult of degenerate Eskimos whose religion, a curious form of devil-worship, chilled him with its deliberate bloodthirstiness and repulsiveness.\n\nIt was a faith of which other Eskimos knew little, and which they mentioned only with shudders, saying that it had come down from horribly ancient eons before ever the world was made..."
 nda_ritual.1860.f:0 "There were certain queer hereditary rituals addressed to a supreme elder devil or tornasuk; and of this Professor Webb had taken a careful phonetic copy from an aged angekok or wizard-priest, expressing the sounds in Roman letters as best he knew how.\n\nOf prime significance was the fetish which this cult had cherished, and around which they danced when the aurora leaped high over the ice cliffs.\n\nIt was, the professor stated, a very crude bas-relief of stone, comprising a hideous picture and some cryptic writing.\n\n #ITALIC Ph'nglui mglw'nafh Cthulhu R'lyeh wgah'nagl fhtagn#!."

The stars were right again, and what an age-old cult had failed to do by design, a band of innocent sailors had done by accident...\n\nHis accursed city is sunken once more... He must have been trapped by the sinking whilst within his black abyss, or else the world would by now be screaming with fright and frenzy...\n\n#ITALIC Ph'nglui mglw'nafh Cthulhu R'lyeh wgah'nagl fhtagn#!."
