nda_historic.1838.d:1 "By the mid-1830s a wave of religious zeal was sweeping across the USA.\n\nDriven by charismatic preachers who called for the faithful to return to the original teachings of the Bible and lead upstanding moral lives, the movement would spawn several new Protestant sects, lead to debates and schisms within established sects over points of theology and ritual, and reinforce the power and influence of Christian teachings among the lower and middle classes of the American people."

nda_historic.1848.f:1 "'Spiritualists are in the habit of taking March 31, 1848, as the beginning of all psychic things, because their own movement dates from that day.\n\n...one of the great points of psychic evolution was reached, for it was then that young Kate Fox challenged the unseen power to repeat the snaps of her fingers.' - Sir Arthur Conan Doyle"

nda_historic.1852.f:1 "... All was still, hushed as the grave — we looked at each other but spoke not, for words were inadequate for the occasion, as they had noi power to express the throbbing tumult of the heart — had we crossed the stormy Atlantic only to reap disappointment for our reward?\n\nImpossible! they will not desert us now. But hark! a slight tremor is felt in the table; a few faint ticks or raps are heard. Our hearts beat more freely, a mountain haa fallen from our shoulders.\n\n'Oh, thou of little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt?' But louder and firmer came the gentle patterings until the room was musical with the cheering sounds. A moment’s pause succeeds — one long breath of relief is drawn and then comes the call for the alphabet, followed by a well known and to us much loved signal...\n -  Dr. William R. Hayden'"

nda_historic.1854.f:1 "'There exists in nature a force which is much more powerful than steam. This force was known to the ancients - it consists of a universal agent whose supreme law is equilibrium, and whose direction is concerned immediately with the great arcanum of transcendental magic.\n\n This agent, which barely manifests itself under the trial and error of the disciples of Mesmer, is exactly what the adepts of the Middle Ages called the first matter of the great work. The Gnostics represented it as the very body of the Holy Spirit, and it was the object of adoration in the secret rites of the Sabbath or the Temple, under the hieroglyphic figure of Baphomet or the Androgynous Goat of Mendes.'"

nda_historic.1857.f:1 "'Modern spiritualism, so called, discloses all these errors, both in theory and practice, by revealing the higher nature and capabilities of the present life, and its assimilation to the higher sphere.\n\nEach revealment, or manifestation, involves in its regular order, each of the natural elements, from the most ponderable to mlnd and from the most gross or benighted mind, to the purest and most effulgent light, emanating from the mind of Deity himself.\n\nEach requires these elements to be in harmony, that the lower may properly respond to the impulses of the higher, according to the regular law of mechanics.' - Issue I"

nda_historic.1858.d:1 "The French author Allen Kardec has relised a book called 'Le Livre des Esprits' - (The Spirits' Book) where they are aspousing what seems to be a more Christian version of Spiritualism.\n\nIt appears to be an attempt to frame the Spiritualist belief, along with other beliefs such as reincarnation, into a Christian framework."
nda_historic.1858.f:1 "'Strictly speaking, spiritualism is the opposite of materialism and everyone who believes there is something within them that is more than matter are spiritualists; however, it does not necessarily follow that they must therefore believe in the existence of spirits or in communications with the invisible world. Therefore, instead of the words spiritual and spiritualism for designating this latter belief, we have coined and employed the words Spiritist and Spiritism' - Allen Kardec"

nda_historic.1865.f:1 "'If then we adopt the zetetic process to ascertain the true figure and condition of the Earth, we shall find that instead of its being a globe, and moving in space, it is the directly contrary — A Plane; without motion, and unaccompanied by anything in the Firmament analogous to itself.'"

nda_historic.1871.f:1 "'...there came out of this building a form — human; — was it human? It stood on the broad way and looked around, beheld me and approached. It came within a few yards of me, and at the sight and presence of it an indescribable awe and tremor seized me, rooting my feet to the ground. It reminded me of symbolical images of Genius or Demon that are seen on Etruscan vases or limned on the walls of Eastern sepulchres...\n\n...there is no word in any language I know which is an exact synonym for Vril. I should call it electricity, except that it comprehends in its manifold branches other forces of nature, to which, in our scientific nomenclature, differing names are assigned, such as magnetism, galvanism, etc. These people consider that in Vril they have arrived at the unity in natural energic agencies, which has been conjectured by many philosophers above ground...'"
