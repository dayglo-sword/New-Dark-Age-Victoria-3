nda_historic.1848.f: "'Spiritualists are in the habit of taking March 31, 1848, as the beginning of all psychic things, because their own movement dates from that day.\n\n...one of the great points of psychic evolution was reached, for it was then that young Kate Fox challenged the unseen power to repeat the snaps of her fingers.'\n - Sir Arthur Conan Doyle"

nda_historic.1852.f: "...

But hark! a slight tremor is felt in the table; a few faint ticks or raps are heard. Our hearts beat more freely, a mountain haa fallen from our shoulders.\n\n'Oh, thou of little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt?' But louder and firmer came the gentle patterings until the room was musical with the cheering sounds. A moment’s pause succeeds — one long breath of relief is drawn and then comes the call for the alphabet, followed by a well known and to us much loved signal...\n -  Dr. William R. Hayden'"

nda_historic.1854.f: "'There exists in nature a force which is much more powerful than steam. This force was known to the ancients - it consists of a universal agent whose supreme law is equilibrium, and whose direction is concerned immediately with the great arcanum of transcendental magic.\n\n This agent, which barely manifests itself under the trial and error of the disciples of Mesmer, is exactly what the adepts of the Middle Ages called the first matter of the great work. The Gnostics represented it as the very body of the Holy Spirit, and it was the object of adoration in the secret rites of the Sabbath or the Temple, under the hieroglyphic figure of #GREEN Baphomet#! or the #GREEN Androgynous Goat of Mendes#!.'"

nda_historic.1857.f: "'Modern spiritualism, so called, discloses all these errors, both in theory and practice, by revealing the higher nature and capabilities of the present life, and its assimilation to the higher sphere.\n\nEach revealment, or manifestation, involves in its regular order, each of the natural elements, from the most ponderable to mlnd and from the most gross or benighted mind, to the purest and most effulgent light, emanating from the mind of Deity himself.\n\nEach requires these elements to be in harmony, that the lower may properly respond to the impulses of the higher, according to the regular law of mechanics.' - Issue I"

nda_historic.1858.f: "'Strictly speaking, spiritualism is the opposite of materialism and everyone who believes there is something within them that is more than matter are spiritualists; however, it does not necessarily follow that they must therefore believe in the existence of spirits or in communications with the invisible world.

nda_historic.1867.f: "'Our Zelator and Theoricus rituals are quite different from the Scottish rituals and make up half the first order rituals. The Adeptus Minor and Adeptus Major rituals of our second order were copied in R.W. Little’s own hand writing... It is interesting to note that both the Rosicrucian ‘Ne Plus Ultra’, based on the Rose Croix and the Red Cross of Rome and Constantine rituals found by Frater Little both existed before 1825, when Richard Carlile used them in his expose published in the Republican Magazine.'"

It reminded me of symbolical images of Genius or Demon that are seen on Etruscan vases or limned on the walls of Eastern sepulchres...\n\n...there is no word in any language I know which is an exact synonym for Vril. I should call it electricity, except that it comprehends in its manifold branches other forces of nature, to which, in our scientific nomenclature, differing names are assigned, such as magnetism, galvanism, etc. These people consider that in Vril they have arrived at the unity in natural energic agencies, which has been conjectured by many philosophers above ground...'"
