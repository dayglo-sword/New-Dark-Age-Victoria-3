# Miskatonic Uni - Library and Herbert West
nda_nen.1842.t: "A New University?"
nda_nen.1842.d: "Concerned about the condition of the existing library in Arkham, the citizens have offered to finance a new building to house the considerable collection that Joeseph Orne had aquired from overseas and donated to the local College on his death."
nda_nen.1842.f: "The building is to be known as #BOLD The Orne Library#!. and is to be an integral part of expanding the college campus on the site into a full fledged university - #BOLD The Miskatonic University#!.\n\nHopefully this will become a centre for intellectual studies which will gain the town a notable reputation.\n\nOther locals feel that this would be a waste of funds and that another statue to New England's greatest hero and founding father, President Cabot, is more fitting."
nda_nen.1842.a: "Only good can come of this!"
nda_nen.1842.b: "We don't need no education."

nda_nen.1903.d: "A young doctor by the name of #BOLD Herbert West#! has made a direct appeal to us after his superior at the Miskatonic University Medical School, Dr Allan Halsey, has barred him from the institute after claims of grave robbery!"
nda_nen.1903.f: "West has explained that fresh cadavers are essential for the success of his research, which may eventually lead to immortality! There is also the more serious matter of a number of books not being returned to the world renowned Orne Library!"
nda_nen.1903.a: "This research must continue!"
nda_nen.1903.b: "The correct decision was made."

nda_nen.12.t: "Plague in Arkham"
nda_nen.12.d: "Plague in Arkham! Typhoid deaths and madness abound.\n\nDr Allan Halsey, Dean of the Miskatonic University Medical School has tragically succumed to the disease while treating other victims."
nda_nen.12.f: "To make matters worse for the local inhabitants a lunatic went on a murderous rampage soon after, desecrating the Dean's grave before killing the watchman at Christ Church Cemetery before continuing through the town.\n\nThankfully they have been captured and now reside at Sefton Asylum, presumably for the rest of their natural life."
nda_nen.12.a: "Unfortunate Events"

nda_nen.1918.t: "Research Breakthrough"
nda_nen.1918.d: "It appears that Dr West, of Arkham, has succedeed in creating a new drug that promotes vigour and reduces tiredness in its recipient for a prolonged period of time.\n\nHe assures us it has remarkably few side-effects!"
nda_nen.1918.f: "He recomends that it works best for people with #ITALIC 'sensitive brain... and vigourous physique'#!.\n\nThis could be just what our troops need in future conflicts!"
nda_nen.1918.a: "We must back this!"
nda_nen.1918.b: "Is it too late to stop him?"

nda_nen.1920.t: "Disappearence of Dr West"
nda_nen.1920.d: "Dr Herbert West, the well known medical scientist, has disappeared from his abode in Boston. Authorities are suspicious of foul play after numerous unidentifed people were seen in the area preceding his presumed death."
nda_nen.1920.f: "This came after a breakout from Sefton Asylum in Arkham and it is believed certain of these escaped lunatics may be involved.\n\nA companion of his was found in the basement of his house, their mind apparently broken by the incident. They are being detained as a potential suspect."
nda_nen.1920.a: "Gone to a better place?"

nda_nen.1934.t: "Assault on Laboratory"
nda_nen.1934.d: "The formula for the 'Combat Serum', as devised by the late Dr West, has been stolen from the production facility, and all papers on the process lost!\n\nThe guards have spun a tale that few will believe!"
nda_nen.1934.f: "'There was a strange light, and a fellow appearing out of the middle of it. Gaunt and cloaked in strange garments, he spoke in our heads while we remained transfixed in place by some unknown force.'\n\n #ITALIC 'The waters of Lethe shall be mine alone, and in the far future, beneath a dim sun and sad heavens, I shall have my empire of the dead upon the last continent, Zothique!'#!"
nda_nen.1934.a: "This is not possible!"

nda_nen.16.t: "Plague in Arkham?"
nda_nen.16.d: "Plague in Arkham!\n\nStrange behaviour amongst the war veterans causing concern.\n\nTales of the strange folk wandering the streets at night and graves being desecrated."
nda_nen.16.f: "It would appear that Dr. Wests 'Combat Serum' might have some unfortunate after effects after all.\n\nWith luck these dreadful things might die down soon."
nda_nen.16.a: "I'm sure we can keep a lid on it."

nda_nen.18.t: "The Plague Spreads to [SCOPE.sState('plague_state_scope').GetName]"
nda_nen.18.d: "The 'Plague' is no longer contained to Arkham!\n\nIt has spread to [SCOPE.sState('plague_state_scope').GetName].\n\nSimilar tales of strange folk wandering the streets at night and tombs being desecrated."
nda_nen.18.f: "'I saw outlined against some phosphorescence of the nether world a horde of silent toiling things which only insanity — or worse — could create.\n\nTheir outlines were human, semi-human, fractionally human, and not human at all — the horde was grotesquely heterogeneous.'"
nda_nen.18.a: "We had no choice!"

nda_nen.1845.t: "Devil Worship in Innsmouth"
nda_nen.1845.d: "Senior figures in the town are rumoured to be participating in some form of devil worshippery.\n\nThe sailors homed in the port are suspected to have brought the abhorant customs back from the South Seas where they trade.\n\nIt has apparently also taken hold amongst the fisherfolk of the town."
nda_nen.1845.f: "#ITALIC 'Some of the old timers tell about the black reef off the coast - Devil Reef they call it...\n\nThe story is that there's an whole legion of devils on that reef'#!"
nda_nen.1845.a: "This will not do."

nda_nen.1846.t: "Plague in Innsmouth"
nda_nen.1846.d: "A mysterious plague has hit the coastal town of Innsmouth killing many of the inhabitants.\n\nIt looks like this will cause much decay to the towns principle industries."
nda_nen.1846.f: "#ITALIC '...it was probably some foreign kind of disease brought from China or somewhere by the shipping...\n\nIt surely was bad enough - there were riots over it, and all sorts of ghastly doings that I don't believe ever got outside town...#!'"
nda_nen.1846.a: "Too late to help the poor souls."

# Starry Wisdom Path
nda_nen.1844.t: "New Church Founded"
nda_nen.1844.d: "As is the current fashion, a new Church has been founded in Providence, Rhode Island.\n\nIt appears that it may have a more non-christian alignment to all the other sects coming into existence.\n\nAt least this one is doing some good by physically taking the place of an older deserted building from a previously failed Church."
nda_nen.1844.f: "A certain Professor Enoch Bowen, of Providence, has traveled widely in Egypt, and in 1843, in the course of archaeological investigations of the crypt of Nephren-Ka, made the discovery of an ancient box.\n\nUpon unearthing his find in Egypt, Professor Bowen abandoned his research and returned to Providence, where he purchased the Free-Will Church, and has made it the headquarters of the 'Church of Starry Wisdom'."
nda_nen.1844.a: "New Churches are everywhere!"

nda_nen.1877.t: "Scandal Hit Church!"
nda_nen.1877.d: "Over the years the Starry Wisdom Church has been the center of many rumours, including being involved in a spate of abductions and disappearences.\n\nAn investigation in 1853 came to nothing, but the stories persist, and a mob of Irish boys swarmed the church in 1869 looking for the missing Patrick Regan.\n\nAfter a recent increase in the number of missing the Mayor is asking us to conduct direct action against the church."
nda_nen.1877.f: "''...stories of blood sacrifice... ...of devil-worship with box found in great Egyptian ruins... people say the Shining Trapezohedron shows them heaven & other worlds, that the Haunter of the Dark tells them secrets in some way... ...They call it up by gazing at the crystal, and have a secret language of their own.'"
nda_nen.1877.a: "Leave things be."
nda_nen.1877.b: "A Noble Church!"
nda_nen.1877.c: "Shut it down!"

nda_nen.1878.t: "Goverment Shutdown!"
nda_nen.1878.d: "The Starry Wisdom Church in Providence has been shut down!\n\nA large segment of the congregation appears to have left town completely.\n\nA number of items, including Occult paraphernalia, Esoteric books, and a mysterious box were recovered from the building which has now been boarded up."
nda_nen.1878.f: "'In the centre of the floor rose a curiously angled stone pillar home four feet in height and two in average diameter, covered on each side with bizarre, crudely incised and wholly unrecognizable hieroglyphs. On this pillar rested a metal box of peculiarly asymmetrical form... ...with odd bas-reliefs on the strange box of yellowish metal.\n\n...the figurings were of a monstrous and utterly alien kind; depicting entities which, though seemingly alive, resembled no known life-form ever evolved on this planet.'"
nda_nen.1878.a: "What's in the Box!"
nda_nen.1878.b: "Hide it somewhere safe!"

nda_nen.1879.t: "Church Desecrated!"
nda_nen.1879.d: "The Starry Wisdom Church in Providence has been ransacked by the locals, led by the notorious gang 'The Federal Hill Boys', and forcing the church to close its doors permanently!\n\nA large segment of the congregation appears to have been chased out, and have left town completely.\n\nWith the disappearence of the listed owners the building has now been boarded up."
nda_nen.1879.f: "'Some day the city would step in and take the property for lack of heirs, but little good would come of anybody's touching it. Better it be left alone for the years to topple, lest things be stirred that ought to rest forever in their black abyss.'"
nda_nen.1879.a: "A tragedy or not?"

nda_nen.1880.t: "Shining Trapezohedron"
nda_nen.1880.d: "The box is opened... Its interior holding what looked to be an egg-shaped or irregularly spherical object some four inches through'.\n\nThe sphere turned out to be a nearly black, red-striated polyhedron with many irregular flat surfaces; either a very remarkable crystal of some sort or an artificial object of carved and highly polished mineral matter.\n\nBefore you realize it, you are looking at the stone again, and letting its curious influence call up a nebulous pageantry in your mind...."
nda_nen.1880.f: "'Of the Shining Trapezohedron... a window on all time and space, and tracing its history from the days it was fashioned on dark Yuggoth, before ever the Old Ones brought it to earth.\n\nIt was treasured and placed in its curious box by the crinoid things of Antarctica, salvaged from their ruins by the serpent-men of Valusia, and peered at aeons later in Lemuria by the first human beings.\n\nIt crossed strange lands and stranger seas, and sank with Atlantis, only to be later recovered from the deep.\n\nThe Pharaoh Nephren-Ka built around it a temple with a windowless crypt, and did that which caused his name to be stricken from all monuments and records.\n\n...a kaleidoscopic range of phantasmal images played, all of them dissolving at intervals into the picture of a vast, unplumbed abyss of night wherein whirled suns and worlds of an even profounder blackness.\n\n...the ancient legends of Ultimate Chaos, at whose centre sprawls the blind idiot god Azathoth, Lord of All Things, encircled by his flopping horde of mindless and amorphous dancers, and lulled by the thin monotonous piping of a demoniac flute held in nameless paws.'"
nda_nen.1880.a: "What's that behind me?"

nda_nen.1882.t: "Meteor near Arkham"
nda_nen.1882.d: "Three professors from Miskatonic University have hastened out to the west of Arkham to investigate tales of a 'great rock' falling from the sky\n\nAfter finding the remains in a crater, the professors found the meteorite to consist of an 'oddly soft' material.\n\nThe sample that they took faded away during experiments, which appears to also be the fate of the main body of the stellar object."
nda_nen.1882.f: "'The stone, magnetic as it had been, must have had some peculiar electrical property; for it had “drawn the lightning”...\n\nSix times within an hour the farmer saw the lightning strike the furrow in the front yard, and when the storm was over nothing remained but a ragged pit...\n\nAs was natural, the Arkham papers made much of the incident!'\n\n...nothing was left to do but go back to the laboratory and test again the disappearing fragment left carefully cased in lead. That fragment lasted a week, at the end of which nothing of value had been learned of it. When it had gone, no residue was left behind..."
nda_nen.1882.a: "Disappeared?"

nda_nen.1883.t: "Strange Fruit"
nda_nen.1883.d: "There are reports of possible pollution of the soil west of Arkham, near where last years meteor landed.\n\nThere are worries in the populace that it may threaten the local crops and livestock."
nda_nen.1883.f: "'Never were things of such size seen before, and they held strange colours that could not be put into any words. Their shapes were monstrous, and the horse had snorted at an odour which struck as wholly unprecedented.\n\nThat afternoon several persons drove past to see the abnormal growth, and all agreed that plants of that kind ought never to sprout in a healthy world.'\n\n“It spreads on everything organic that’s been around here,” muttered the medical examiner. No one replied, but the man who had been in the well gave a hint that his long pole must have stirred up something intangible.\n\n “It was awful,” he added. “There was no bottom at all. Just ooze and bubbles and the feeling of something lurking under there.”"
nda_nen.1883.a: "Polluted?"

nda_nen.1893.t: "An Offer of a Chair"
nda_nen.1893.d: "The Miskatonic University are asking you to expediate the arrival of a new Chair of Mathematics and Astronomy.\n\nFound washed up in a river near Zurich the unfortunate man has no memory of their past life, but he appears to be a genius in his field, a true savant.\n\nLack of identity documentation is blocking their entry into the country. It is hoped you can help reslove the situation.\n\nBeing totally fluent in English, he has currently adopted the name of James Morrison."
nda_nen.1893.f: "'He is a man of excellent education, endowed by nature with a phenomenal mathematical faculty.\n\nHe is a genius, a philosopher, an abstract thinker. He has a brain of the first order. He sits motionless, like a spider in the centre of its web...\n\nHis soft, precise fashion of speech leaves a conviction of sincerity...'"

nda_nen.1894.t: "A Crime Wave"
nda_nen.1894.d: "What seems to be an organised crime wavehas broken out in Arkham and the surrounds.\n\nThese are not spontanious acts, but appear to have an underlying intelligence behind them."
nda_nen.1894.f: "'Dark rumours gathered round the university town...\n\nCrimes of the most varying sorts — forgery cases, robberies, murders...\n\nSome deep organizing power which forever stands in the way of the law...'"

nda_nen.1913.d: "A Meteor has been seen over the coast of Maine!\n\nA mammoth ball fire darted from the heavens into the water.\n\nThe following Sunday a fishing party caught in their trawl a mass of metallic rock.\n\nIt was discovered within this mass a strange book made of an unknown substance.\n\nThe writing within has been identified as ancient Greek from the Second Century BC!"
nda_nen.1913.f: "The tale within, as translated by scholars tells of a persons transportation to a floating isle that consisted of a single green meadow and of their journey to oblivion!"

nda_nen.1922.d: "A number of visitors to Martin's Beach have lost their lives after cruelly being dragged out to sea.\n\nThey had been attracted to the wealthy resort to see the body of a strange 50ft sea creature that had been put on display by Captain James P. Orne.\n\nStormy seas had caused the creature's display to be washed out to sea and Capt. Orne had arranged for the tourists to help in its recovery."
nda_nen.1922.f: "Witnesses describe how they remained routed to the spot, as the tragic victims seemed to be unable to detached themselves from the ropes attached to the body of the creature.\n\nAs the tide rose the indivduals were slowly dragged out to sea.\n\nIn response to this incident, a Professor Alton has already released an article with the title #ITALIC 'Are Hypnotic Powers Confined to Recognised Humanity?' #!"

nda_nen.1935.d: "It is one of those unfortunate affairs where you have to share transportation on your journey.\n\nUnfortunate, in that you are sitting opposite that one person who can not keep themselves to themselves.\n\nThey were head deep in a book, but you could still tell that their face was gradually reddening, and then they burst forth and address you directly..."
nda_nen.1935.f: "'Can you believe this nonsense!\n\nThat everything is being run in secret by a select band of long-lived people!\n\nThe idea that we humans have no general agency, that everything, from the economy, to the form of government itself, is governed by entities beyond our control!\n\nIt's preposterous! What sort of a person could ever have such power and not reveal themselves?'"
