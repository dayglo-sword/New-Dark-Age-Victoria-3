nda_pan.1.t: "An Experiment"
nda_pan.1.d: "News has reached us, via our agents, of a rather disturbing experiment. It was conducted by a Dr. Raymond, who has devoted themselves to transcendental medicine for the last twenty years.\n\nIt was conducted upon a poor young lady, Mary, who Dr Raymond had adopted as their own just for the purpose of the experiment!\n\nThey obviously thought conducting it in a remote location would keep it a secret; though the results are probably best left undisclosed to the public."
nda_pan.1.f: "'There is a real world, but it is beyond this glamour and this vision,... you and I shall see it lifted this very night from before another’s eyes. You may think this all strange nonsense; it may be strange, but it is true, and the ancients knew what lifting the veil means. They called it seeing the god Pan.'\n\n'a slight lesion in the grey matter, that is all; a trifling rearrangement of certain cells, a microscopical alteration that would escape the attention of ninety-nine brain specialists out of a hundred'\n\n'She was lying wide-awake, rolling her head from side to side, and grinning vacantly. “Yes,” said the doctor, still quite cool, “it is a great pity; she is a hopeless idiot. However, it could not be helped; and, after all, she has seen the Great God Pan.'"
nda_pan.1.a: "Most Horrific!"

nda_pan.2.t: "Memoirs to prove the Existence of the Devil"
nda_pan.2.d: "Our agents have come into contact with a Mr. Clarke, who's unpublished memoirs might shed light onto current ongoings.\n\nIf our information is correct then this person had connections with a Dr. Raymond, who conducted some notorious experiments in the 1860's.\n\nThe story that has so perturbed Mr. Clarke involves incidents that occured in a village on the borders of Wales..."
nda_pan.2.f: "The persons concerned in this statement are Helen V., who, if she is still alive, must now be a woman of twenty-three. Rachel M., since deceased, who was a year younger.\n\n Helen still retained her extraordinary fondness for the forest, and on several occasions Rachel accompanied her...  One evening, however, after Rachel had come home, her mother found her lying, half undressed, upon the bed, evidently in the greatest distress. As soon as she saw her mother, she exclaimed, “Ah, mother, mother, why did you let me go to the forest with Helen?\n\n...Her flight remains a mystery to this day; she vanished in broad sunlight; they saw her walking in a meadow, and a few moments later she was not there...\n\n...the men had found a curious stone head, evidently of the Roman period, which had been placed in the manner described. The head is pronounced by the most experienced archaeologists of the district to be that of a faun or satyr..."
nda_pan.2.a: "Evil Doings."
nda_pan.2.b: "Hardy Supernatural!"

nda_pan.3.t: "A Discovery in Paul Street"
nda_pan.3.d: "Mr. Clarke appears to attract strange tales.\n\nMr Villiers has told him the story of the demise of a former university companion.\n\nThe deceased was known as Charles Herbert, and is believed to have been once a prosperous country gentleman."
nda_pan.3.f: "...what he had seen and heard haunted him by night and day, and when I looked in his face I knew he was speaking the truth....\n\n...died of sheer terror; he saw something so awful, so terrible, that it cut short his life. And what he saw, he most certainly saw in that house...\n\nThat’s how I identified it as being a portrait of Herbert’s wife, or I should say his widow... This word — ‘Helen’ — was written on the back. Didn’t I tell you her name was Helen? Yes; Helen Vaughan. "
nda_pan.3.a: "Helen V?"
nda_pan.3.b: "Coincedences."

nda_pan.10.t: "The Golden Tiberius"
nda_pan.10.d: "A legendary ancient coin with historical associations with the occult has both reappeared and disappered within a short space of time.\n\nIt had been aquired by Mr. James Headley, F.S.A., from his agent in Armenia. He has since disappeared on a visit to London to display the coin.\n\nThe coin in question is The Golden Tiberius, with the Emporer on the front, and a depiction of a faun on the reverse."
nda_pan.10.f: "'A whole cycle of legend has gathered round the thing; the tale goes that it formed part of an issue struck by Tiberius to commemorate an infamous excess. You see the legend on the reverse: 'Victoria.' It is said that by an extraordinary accident the whole issue was thrown into the melting pot, and that only this one coin escaped. It glints through history and legend, appearing and disappearing, with intervals of a hundred years in time and continents in place. It was discovered by an Italian humanist, and lost and rediscovered. It has not been heard of since 1727, when Sir Joshua Byrde, a Turkey merchant, brought it home from Aleppo, and vanished with it a month after he had shown it to the virtuosi, no man knew or knows where.'"
nda_pan.10.a: "Worth investigating further!"
nda_pan.10.b: "A trifle of a thing."

nda_pan.11.t: "The Black Seal"
nda_pan.11.d: "The disappearance of Professor Gregg."
nda_pan.11.f: "'...never will I write the phrases which tell me how man can be reduced to the slime from which he came, and be forced to put on the flesh of the reptile and the snake...'"

nda_pan.14.t: "A Body"
nda_pan.14.d: "!"
nda_pan.14.f: "'The body was torn and mutilated in the most hideous fashion, scarred with the marks of red-hot irons, a shameful ruin of the human shape. But upon the middle of the body a fire of coals was smouldering; the flesh had been burned through. The man was dead, but the smoke of his torment mounted still, a black vapour.'"
