nda_whh.10.d: "Mysterious disappearence of elderly couple at country house in Galway, Ireland.\n\nOnly a manuscript remains to identify the victims... containing a strange tale of Pig-Faced people living in a near by pit who go about assaulting the inhabitants.\n\nThe house is now in ruined after collapsing into the pit."
nda_whh.10.f: "'From the Pit, came a deep, hoarse Babel of swine-talk. At times, angry cries smote the air, and they would be answered by multitudinous gruntings. It occurred to me, that they were holding some kind of a council, perhaps to discuss the problem of entering the house...\n\n... I could understand why the noises—on the first night of the invasion—had seemed to rise directly from under my feet. And the chuckle that had sounded when first I opened the trap! Evidently, some of the Swine-things must have been right beneath me...\n\n..Something, luminous and ghostly, encircled it, and grew upon my vision. It resolved into a glowing hand, transparent, with a lambent, greenish flame flickering over it...'"

nda_whh.11.f: "'In response to Carnacki's usual card of invitation to have dinner and listen to a story, I arrived promptly at 427, Cheyne Walk, to find the three others who were always invited to these happy little times, there before me. Five minutes later, Carnacki, Arkright, Jessop, Taylor, and I were all engaged in the 'pleasant occupation' of dining...\n\n'This is a curious yarn that I am going to tell you,' said Carnacki, as after a quiet little dinner we made ourselves comfortable in his cozy dining room.'"

nda_whh.13.f: "'He turned to now fit the Electric Pentacle, setting it so that each of its 'points' and 'vales' coincided exactly with the drawn pentagram upon the floor,\n\n...the next instant the pale blue glare from the intertwining vacuum tubes shone out."
nda_whh.13.a: "We should back this.'"

nda_whh.14.f: "'It's like a spiritual earthquake. The howling, sqealing, grunting, rolling clamour of swinish noise.\n\nA strange flash of blue flame ripped open... and I saw for one brief instant the pallid monstrosity of the Hog, stark and pale and dreadful.'"
